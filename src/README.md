Provide the body of the method classify which when given a char holding a letter of the 
alphabet, returns a String reporting whether the letter is uppercase or lowercase, and 
whether the letter is a vowel or a consonant, with a space in-between. Recall that a, e, i, o, 
and u are considered to be vowels, and all other letters are considered to be consonants.

string should be returned.
For example, classify( ‘E’ ) should return the String "uppercase vowel".
